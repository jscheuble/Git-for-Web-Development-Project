    2. What is HTML used for? 
    HTML is used as the structure and fundamentals of a web page.

    image tag <img src="#"> and a tag <a href="#">

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
    The head contains all of our metadata as well as any links to external sources. Information inside of the head is not visible on the web page. 

    7. What is an id? 
    The id attribute can be used to single out a specific element for styling. A page can have multiple id's, but each id should only be used once.

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
    Id's can be added to any element that appears in multiples within your HTML doc. Ex. If i have 7 different divs, I can place an id on one to add specific styles to that id.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page?
    The same id can only be used once. 

    10. What is a class?
    A class, like an id, is used for specifically styling certain elements. We can create a class wrapped around a section of code, and call on that class using CSS to style the code within the class wrapper. 

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
    A class can be added to any HTML element. 

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page?

    Id's are referenced with the octothorpe #id

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
    A div tag is not semantic. It breaks up our code without meaning and is more useful for styling purposes. Section tags provide meaning by showing content that was intentionally grouped together as a section of the webpage.

    CSS is used for styling and making our webpages look visually attractive.

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
    To select an element, simply type the name of the element followed by curly brackets. Ex.
    h2 {
        property: value;
    }

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
    A class can be used to style multiple elements while an id singles out one specific element. If I'm writing a blog and I want each of my entries to have the same styling, I can place each entry in the same class to keep the styling consistent. If I have multiple entries and I want to apply specific styles to one, I can place an ID on that entry to style that one differently. 

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
    Classes are selected using a period followed by the class name.

    .class {
        property: value;
    }

    }

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
    The parent child selector styles not only the parent element but every element nested within the parent. This is useful in keeping our code clean so we do not have to list every single element that we would like to style. I can select a div, and all of the headings, p tags, sections etc within that div will inherit the same styles. 

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
    div.sidebar a {
        property: value;
    }

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
    rm - rf followed by file name
    We must be careful because this command is irreversible.

    34. Why should I use version control? 
    Version control gives us the ability to revert our project back to any previous version in existence. This is extremely helpful if changes are made accidentally or if problems arise in our code. It also allows us to work alongside other developers without altering the original parent file. 

    35. How often should I commit to github?
    Fairly often, but not too often. Every time an important change is made or a block of code is added, the file should be committed.

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github?

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Block elements have their own line, while inline elements do not. Spans can be placed in the middle of a p tag with no visible change to the html, however sections and divs are block elements and they will change the HTML layout.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    If an element's position is absolute, that means it is fixed. Placement can be offset using top, right, bottom and left properties.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
